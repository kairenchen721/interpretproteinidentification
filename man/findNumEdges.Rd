\title{Finds the Number of Edges in an idXML File}
\usage{
findNumEdges(peptideIdentificationObjectVector)
}
\arguments{
\item{peptideIdentificationObjectVector}{the vector holding one or more
peptide Identification Objects}
}
\value{
the number of edges
}
\description{
each mapping of protein to peptide counts as one edges, this function counts
that
}
\details{
it looks at the length of each peptideEvidenceVector which is inside of each
peptidehit, which in turn is inside of each peptide identification
}
